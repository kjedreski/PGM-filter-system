// Watch out for corners and edges








//The processing procedure works as follows. For each pixel of an image, you consider an (n x n) window centered on that pixel, 
	//compute the median of gray-level values in the window, and the median becomes the new gray-level value of the new image.
	//The median is defined as the middle value in a sorted sequence. For example, consider the following (3 x 3) window of pixels:
